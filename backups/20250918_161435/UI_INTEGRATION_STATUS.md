2. **Peer Comparison**: `/peer-comparison/:id`
3. **Network Relationships**: `/network/:id`
4. **Iceberg Opportunities**: `/opportunities/iceberg`
5. **Portfolio Risk**: `/portfolios/:id/risk-analysis`

### UI Components (Port 3601)
The UI is running at `http://localhost:3601/` with:

   - 36-month historical data visualization
   - Revenue, contracts, growth rates
   - Activity status indicators

2. **‚úÖ Competitive Benchmarking Panel** (`CompetitiveBenchmarkPanel.tsx`)
   - Peer percentile rankings
   - Radar chart visualization

3. **‚úÖ Iceberg Opportunities Explorer** (`IcebergOpportunities.tsx`)
   - Full page at `/platform` ‚Üí "Iceberg Opportunities" tab
   - Scoring algorithm (0-100)
   - Tier-based filtering

4. **‚úÖ Enhanced Contractor Modal** (`EnhancedContractorModal.tsx`)
   - Tabbed interface with all new features
   - Integrated into identify page
   - Real-time data fetching

5. **‚úÖ Network Visualization** (Basic implementation in modal)
   - Prime-sub relationships
   - Collaboration strength scores

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. Start Both Services
```bash
# Terminal 1 - API (should already be running)
cd apps/api
bun run dev  # Port 4001

# Terminal 2 - UI (should already be running)
cd apps/ui
bun run dev  # Port 3601
```

### 2. Login to Platform
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3601
2. Login with test credentials or register new account
3. Go to `/platform` route

### 3. Test Critical Features

#### A. Iceberg Opportunities
1. Click "Iceberg Opportunities" tab in platform navigation
2. Should see contractors with high sub revenue vs prime revenue
3. Filter by score (50+, 75+, 90+)
4. Click cards to see details

#### B. Enhanced Contractor Details
1. Go to "Identify Targets" tab
2. Search for any contractor
3. Click on a contractor card
4. Modal should show tabs for:
   - Overview (existing)
   - Performance Trends (NEW - 36-month chart)
   - Competitive Analysis (NEW - peer benchmarking)
   - Network (NEW - relationships)

#### C. Performance Trends
- In contractor modal, click "Performance Trends" tab
- Should see line/area chart with monthly data
- Hover for detailed tooltips
- Use brush to zoom time periods

#### D. Competitive Benchmarking
- In contractor modal, click "Competitive Analysis" tab
- Should see radar chart with percentiles
- View market position (leader/challenger/follower)
- Check percentile cards for revenue/growth/performance

## üìä Data Requirements

For full functionality, ensure:
1. **Snowflake data is loaded** (14.4M records)
2. **Performance indexes are created** (migration 0009)
3. **All 7 dimensional tables have data**:
   - contractor_universe
   - contractor_metrics_monthly
   - peer_comparisons_monthly
   - portfolio_breakdowns_monthly
   - subcontractor_metrics_monthly
   - contractor_network_metrics
   - contractor_iceberg_opportunities

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If no data appears:
1. Check API is running: `curl http://localhost:4001/health`
2. Check authentication: Ensure logged in with valid token
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify data is loaded: Run ETL script if needed

### If charts don't render:
1. Check browser console for Recharts errors
2. Verify data format matches component expectations
3. Check network tab for API responses

### If API returns 404:
1. Routes are at `/api/v1/analytics/*` not `/api/v1/contractors/*`
2. Ensure using correct endpoint paths
3. Check API server logs for route registration
