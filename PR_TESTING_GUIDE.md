# Pull Request Testing Guide - Docker & CI/CD Setup

## Branch: `feat/docker-cicd-setup`

This PR adds Docker containerization and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for the GoldenGate MVP application.

## What's Included

âœ… **Docker Setup**
- API Dockerfile (Bun + Elysia)
- UI Dockerfile (React + Vite with nginx)
- Docker Compose for local testing
- Security best practices (non-root users)

âœ… **GitHub Actions**
- CI workflow for testing on PRs
- Deploy workflow for building and pushing to ECR
- Auto-deployment to EC2 (enabled for this branch for testing)

âœ… **Scripts & Documentation**
- Build and push script for manual deployment
- Comprehensive deployment documentation
- GitHub Actions setup guide

## Testing Steps

### 1. Set Up GitHub Secrets

Before the workflows can run, add these secrets in GitHub:

1. Go to: https://github.com/fidelescap/gg-mvp/settings/secrets/actions
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret key

### 2. Create Pull Request

1. Go to: https://github.com/fidelescap/gg-mvp/pull/new/feat/docker-cicd-setup
2. Create PR from `feat/docker-cicd-setup` to `main`
3. The CI workflow will automatically run

### 3. Monitor GitHub Actions

Watch the workflows run:
- **CI Pipeline**: Will test and lint the code
- **Build and Deploy**: Will build Docker images and push to ECR
- **Deploy Job**: Will deploy to EC2 (enabled for this test branch)

### 4. Verify Deployment

Once workflows complete successfully:

```bash
# Check application is running
curl http://34.231.242.151/health

# Check API
curl http://34.231.242.151/api/health

# SSH to EC2 to check logs (if needed)
ssh -i gg-infra/terraform/gg-mvp-key.pem ec2-user@34.231.242.151
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Expected Outcomes

### On This Feature Branch Push
1. âœ… Docker images built
2. âœ… Images pushed to ECR
3. âœ… Application deployed to EC2
4. âœ… Health checks pass

### After Merge to Main
- Same process, but triggered automatically on every push to main
- Feature branch deployment condition will be removed

## Troubleshooting

### If Workflows Fail

1. **Check Secrets**: Ensure AWS credentials are correctly set
2. **Check Logs**: Click on failed job in GitHub Actions
3. **ECR Access**: Verify IAM user has ECR permissions
4. **EC2 Access**: Ensure EC2 instance is running

### Required IAM Permissions

The AWS IAM user needs:
- ECR: Push/pull permissions
- EC2: Describe instances
- SSM: Send commands (for deployment)

### Manual Testing (Local)

If you have Docker running locally:

```bash
# Build images locally
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

# Run locally
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up

# Access at http://localhost
```

## Files Changed

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI pipeline
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deploy pipeline  
- `apps/api/Dockerfile` - API container
- `apps/ui/Dockerfile` - UI container
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Local testing
- `scripts/build-and-push.sh` - Manual deploy script
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Full documentation

## Next Steps After Testing

1. âœ… Verify builds succeed
2. âœ… Verify deployment works
3. âœ… Test application functionality
4. âœ… Review and approve PR
5. âœ… Merge to main
6. ðŸ”§ Remove feature branch from deploy condition

## Notes

- The deploy workflow is temporarily enabled for `feat/docker-cicd-setup` branch for testing
- After successful testing and merge, update the deploy workflow to only deploy from `main`
- ECR lifecycle policies will keep only the last 5 images to save costs
